### Who I am

ðŸ”­ Hi, My name is Nicholas Eduardo, I am a Product Engineer. In the last years, I worked with hybrid applications with React Native and system development with React, NodeJs, MongoDB and TypeScript. I was CTO for 3 years ago. I like to work with MVP and rump up with digital products.

On my journey, I learn and like work about business, growth, marketing, design, pixel perfect, communication between the CEO, designer, and other people to understand and transform the idea for a system.
