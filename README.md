### Who I am

Hello, my name is Nicholas Eduardo and I am a product engineer with extensive experience in systems and application development. For the past few years, I've been working with hybrid technologies like React Native, as well as other popular tools like React, NodeJs, MongoDB, and TypeScript. In addition, I have served as CTO for three years.

I enjoy working closely with multidisciplinary teams to create digital products that meet market needs. My preferred approach is to focus on MVPs and ramp up based on feedback to ensure the final product is a success.

Throughout my professional journey, I have acquired skills and knowledge in several areas, including business, marketing, design and communication. This allows me to better understand the client's needs and collaborate effectively with other team members such as the CEO, designers and other professionals. My goal is to transform ideas into successful digital products, taking into account all aspects of the development process, from conception to final delivery.
